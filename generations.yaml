    description: "The Toyota Corolla Hybrid represents the first global application of Toyota's proven hybrid technology to the company's best-selling nameplate, though hybrid variants had been available in some markets in previous generations. Based on the twelfth-generation (E210) Corolla and built on the TNGA-C platform, the Corolla Hybrid combines the model's established reliability and practicality with significantly improved fuel efficiency. Visually nearly identical to the conventional Corolla sedan aside from subtle hybrid badging and unique wheel designs on some trim levels, the Corolla Hybrid features a powertrain combining a 1.8-liter Atkinson-cycle four-cylinder engine with two motor-generators and a nickel-metal hydride battery pack (switched to lithium-ion in some markets/trims after the 2023 refresh), producing a combined 121 horsepower (increased to 138 horsepower for the 2023 update in some regions). Power is delivered to the front wheels through an electronically controlled continuously variable transmission (E-CVT), with all-wheel drive becoming available for the 2023 model year through the addition of a third electric motor powering the rear wheels. Fuel economy is exceptional at up to 53 mpg combined in the EPA cycle for front-wheel drive modelsâ€”comparable to the dedicated Prius hybrid. The interior is largely identical to the standard Corolla, featuring an 8-inch (later up to 10.5-inch) touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, hybrid-specific displays in the instrument cluster, and available features including heated seats, wireless charging, and premium audio on higher trims. Standard on all variants is Toyota Safety Sense 2.0 or later, providing advanced driver assistance features including adaptive cruise control, lane tracking assist, and pre-collision system with pedestrian detection. The Corolla Hybrid successfully combines the model's traditional virtues of reliability, value, and practicality with impressive fuel efficiency and reduced emissions, appealing to environmentally conscious consumers seeking a familiar, mainstream vehicle rather than a dedicated hybrid model with more distinctive styling."
